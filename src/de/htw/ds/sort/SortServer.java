/**
 * Server that provides stateful sorting using a custom TCP based sort protocol (CSP). Note
 * that this class is declared final because it provides an application entry point, and is
 * therefore not supposed to be extended. Also note that the simple CSP protocol only
 * allows for string sorters, and it's syntax is defined in EBNF as follows; note that two
 * subsequent line separators demarcate the end of CSP requests and responses - the same
 * technique is used to demarcate the end of HTTP request and response headers:
 * <pre>
 * cspRequest	:= { element, CR }, CR
 * cspResponse	:= { element, CR }, CR
 * CR			:= line separator
 * element		:= utf8-string - (null | "")
 * </pre>
